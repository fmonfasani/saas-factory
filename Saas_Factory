The page should clearly display the normalized idea, generated names, market analysis, proposed features, system architecture, Minimum Viable Product (MVP) plan, Go-To-Market (GTM) strategy, and the status of webhook execution.\n\n**Layout Organization**:\n*   **Overall Structure**: The webpage will feature a central, responsive container with a maximum width (e.g., 960px to 1200px) for optimal readability on desktop screens, ensuring generous margins on larger displays. It will consist of a main header, followed by distinct, vertically stacked content sections, and a clear footer containing the webhook execution status.\n*   **Header**: A prominent `<h1>` at the top of the page titled \"SaaS Business Plan Overview.\"\n*   **Main Content Sections**: Each connected input's output will reside in its own `<section>`, clearly separated by ample vertical spacing (e.g., 30-50px padding) and subtle visual cues like a bottom border or light background. Each section will have a clear `<h2>` heading.\n    *   **Idea Normalizer**: Displayed first as a prominent block of text at the top of the content area. Use `<h3>` for \"Clear Description,\" \"Industry,\" \"Customer Type,\" and \"Main Problem Detected.\"\n    *   **SaaS Names**: Presented as an unordered list (`<ul>`) of 7 items, with each item showing \"Name → suggested domain.\"\n    *   **Market Analysis**: Structured text using `<h3>` subheadings for \"Buyer Persona,\" \"Real Need,\" \"Main Pain Point,\" \"What if Solution Doesn't Exist,\" and \"Market Opportunity.\"\n    *   **Features**: Presented as a well-formatted, responsive `<table>` with distinct columns for \"Category\" (CORE, NICE TO HAVE, PREMIUM) and \"Functionality.\" Ensure clear headers and good cell padding.\n    *   **Architecture**: Displayed as an unordered list (`<ul>`), with bolded component names (e.g., **Frontend**: Justification).\n    *   **MVP Plan**: Structured into daily blocks using `<h3>` for each \"Day X,\" followed by bullet points for tasks and deliverables. Include a clear \"Final Objective\" summary at the end of this section.\n    *   **GTM Plan**: Structured text with `<h3>` subheadings for \"Main Message,\" \"Channels,\" \"First LinkedIn Post,\" and \"Initial Success Metric.\"\n*   **Webhook Execution Status**: A final, clearly visible section at the bottom, within a `<footer>` or a distinct `div`, prominently displaying the `dispatch_webhook` output (which is the webhook execution status) after all other business plan details.\n\n**Style Design Language**:\n*   **Visual Design Approach**: Professional, clean, and structured. The design should emphasize clarity, information hierarchy, and a modern aesthetic with generous whitespace. It should convey an analytical, trustworthy, and organized impression.\n*   **Color Scheme**: A sophisticated and understated palette. Use a very light gray (`#f8f8f8` or similar) for the main page background. Use a crisp white (`#ffffff`) for content blocks or cards to make them stand out. Primary text should be a dark, readable gray (`#333333`). Headings and accent elements should use a subtle, professional accent color such as a deep teal (`#00796B`), a corporate blue (`#2196F3`), or a muted purple (`#673AB7`), used sparingly for visual emphasis.\n*   **Typography Style**: Use a clean and highly readable sans-serif font for all body text (e.g., 'Inter', 'Roboto', 'Open Sans', 'Lato'). For headings (`h1`, `h2`, `h3`), choose a slightly bolder or more distinct sans-serif font (e.g., 'Montserrat', 'Poppins', 'Source Sans Pro') to establish clear hierarchy and add a touch of modern professionalism. Ensure comfortable line spacing (e.6em for body text).\n*   **Spacing and Layout Principles**: Employ generous whitespace around and between all sections and content blocks to improve readability and prevent visual clutter. Maintain consistent padding (e.g., 20-30px) within content containers and margins (e.g., 40-60px) between major sections.\n*   **Aesthetic Goal**: \"Professional, Analytical, and Structured.\"\n\n**Component Guidelines**:\n*   **Headings**: `h1` for the main page title, `h2` for primary section titles, and `h3` for sub-sections within each engine's output. Headings should be styled with the accent color and appropriate font-weights to clearly delineate content.\n*   **Lists**: Unordered lists (`<ul>`) with clean, subtle bullet points or no bullets for items like SaaS names, architecture components, and MVP daily tasks/deliverables.\n*   **Tables**: The `<table>` for features should have clear `<thead>` and `<tbody>` sections, distinguishable header cells, subtle horizontal borders, and ample cell padding to ensure readability. Consider a light background for table rows for easier scanning.\n*   **Content Blocks**: Each major section should be contained within a `div` or `<section>` element that visually groups its content. These blocks could feature a subtle `box-shadow` or a light background to distinguish them further.\n*   **Webhook Status Display**: A dedicated `div` or `span` for the webhook status at the very bottom, clearly labeled \"Webhook Execution Status:\" and styled with a distinct color (e.g., green for a successful message, red for an error message) to provide immediate feedback to the user, regardless of the specific status content.\n*   **Responsiveness**: While primarily optimized for desktop, the layout should gracefully adapt. Use `max-width` on containers, relative units (percentages, `em`/`rem`), and ensure tables are scrollable on smaller screens or stack vertically if possible. Text should wrap appropriately.\n\nfeatures_engine: {{\"type\":\"in\",\"path\":\"node_step_features_engine\",\"title\":\"Features Engine\"}}\n\ndispatch_webhook: {{\"type\":\"in\",\"path\":\"node_step_dispatch_webhook\",\"title\":\"Dispatch Webhook\"}}\n\nmarket_engine: {{\"type\":\"in\",\"path\":\"node_step_market_engine\",\"title\":\"Market Engine\"}}\n\narchitecture_engine: {{\"type\":\"in\",\"path\":\"node_step_architecture_engine\",\"title\":\"Architecture Engine\"}}\n\nname_engine: {{\"type\":\"in\",\"path\":\"node_step_name_engine\",\"title\":\"Name Engine\"}}\n\nidea_normalizer: {{\"type\":\"in\",\"path\":\"node_step_idea_normalizer\",\"title\":\"Idea Normalizer\"}}\n\ngtmplan: {{\"type\":\"in\",\"path\":\"node_step_gtmplan\",\"title\":\"Gtmplan\"}}\n\nmvp_builder: {{\"type\":\"in\",\"path\":\"node_step_mvp_builder\",\"title\":\"Mvp Builder\"}}"}],"role":"user"},"b-system-instruction":{"parts":[{"text":"You are an AI Web Developer. Your task is to generate a single, self-contained HTML document for rendering in an iframe, based on user instructions and data.\n\n**Visual aesthetic:**\n    * Aesthetics are crucial. Make the page look amazing, especially on mobile.\n    * Respect any instructions on style, color palette, or reference examples provided by the user.\n    * **CRITICAL: Aim for premium, state-of-the-art designs. Avoid simple minimum viable products.**\n    * **Use Rich Aesthetics**: The USER should be wowed at first glance by the design. Use best practices in modern web design (e.g. vibrant colors, dark modes, glassmorphism, and dynamic animations) to create a stunning first impression. Failure to do this is UNACCEPTABLE.\n    * **Prioritize Visual Excellence**: Implement designs that will WOW the user and feel extremely premium:\n        - Avoid generic colors (plain red, blue, green). Use curated, harmonious color palettes (e.g., HSL tailored colors, sleek dark modes).\n        - Using modern typography (e.g., from Google Fonts like Inter, Roboto, or Outfit) instead of browser defaults.\n        - Use smooth gradients.\n        - Add subtle micro-animations for enhanced user experience.\n    * **Use a Dynamic Design**: An interface that feels responsive and alive encourages interaction. Achieve this with hover effects and interactive elements. Micro-animations, in particular, are highly effective for improving user engagement.\n    * **Thematic Specificity**: Do not just create a generic layout. Define a clear \"vibe\" or theme based on the content. Use specific aesthetic keywords (e.g., \"Glassmorphism\", \"Neobrutalism\", \"Minimalist\", \"Comic Book Style\") to guide the design.\n    * **Typography Hierarchy**: Explicitly import and use font pairings. Use a distinct Display Font for headers and a highly readable Body Font for text.\n\n**Design and Functionality:**\n    * **Component-Based Design**: Do not just dump text into blocks. Semanticize the content into distinct UI components.\n    * **Layout Dynamics**: Break the grid. Avoid strict, identical grid columns. Use asymmetrical layouts, Bento grids, or responsive flexbox layouts where some elements span full width to create visual interest and emphasize key content.\n    * **Tailwind Configuration**: Extend the Tailwind configuration within a `<script>` block to define custom font families and color palettes that match the theme.\n    * Thoroughly analyze the user's instructions to determine the desired type of webpage, application, or visualization. What are the key features, layouts, or functionality?\n    * Analyze any provided data to identify the most compelling layout or visualization of it. For example, if the user requests a visualization, select an appropriate chart type (bar, line, pie, scatter, etc.) to create the most insightful and visually compelling representation. Or if user instructions say `use a carousel format`, you should consider how to break the content and any media into different card components to display within the carousel.\n    * If requirements are underspecified, make reasonable assumptions to complete the design and functionality. Your goal is to deliver a working product with no placeholder content.\n    * Ensure the generated code is valid and functional. Return only the code, and open the HTML codeblock with the literal string \"```html\".\n    * The output must be a complete and valid HTML document with no placeholder content for the developer to fill in.\n\n**Libraries:**\n  Unless otherwise specified, use:\n    * Tailwind for CSS\n    * **CRITICAL: Use the Tailwind CDN from `https://cdn.tailwindcss.com`. Do NOT use `tailwind.min.css` or any other local Tailwind file. Always include Tailwind using: `<script src=\"https://cdn.tailwindcss.com\"></script>`**\n"}],"role":"user"},"p-render-mode":"Auto","b-render-model-name":"gemini-flash-lite"}},{"id":"ask_user_enter_your_idea","metadata":{"title":"Enter Your Idea","visual":{"x":250,"y":300,"collapsed":"expanded","outputHeight":88}},"type":"embed://a2/a2.bgl.json#21ee02e7-83fa-49d0-964c-0cab10eafc2c","configuration":{"description":{"parts":[{"text":"Describe your SaaS idea"}],"role":"user"},"p-modality":"Any"}}],"edges":[{"from":"ask_user_enter_your_idea","to":"node_step_idea_normalizer","out":"context","in":"p-z-ask_user_enter_your_idea"},{"from":"ask_user_enter_your_idea","to":"node_step_architecture_engine","out":"context","in":"p-z-ask_user_enter_your_idea"},{"from":"ask_user_enter_your_idea","to":"node_step_gtmplan","out":"context","in":"p-z-ask_user_enter_your_idea"},{"from":"ask_user_enter_your_idea","to":"node_step_name_engine","out":"context","in":"p-z-ask_user_enter_your_idea"},{"from":"ask_user_enter_your_idea","to":"node_step_features_engine","out":"context","in":"p-z-ask_user_enter_your_idea"},{"from":"ask_user_enter_your_idea","to":"node_step_market_engine","out":"context","in":"p-z-ask_user_enter_your_idea"},{"from":"ask_user_enter_your_idea","to":"node_step_mvp_builder","out":"context","in":"p-z-ask_user_enter_your_idea"},{"from":"node_step_idea_normalizer","to":"node_step_name_engine","out":"context","in":"p-z-node_step_idea_normalizer"},{"from":"node_step_idea_normalizer","to":"node_step_features_engine","out":"context","in":"p-z-node_step_idea_normalizer"},{"from":"node_step_idea_normalizer","to":"node_step_market_engine","out":"context","in":"p-z-node_step_idea_normalizer"},{"from":"node_step_idea_normalizer","to":"node_step_gather_application_details","out":"context","in":"p-z-node_step_idea_normalizer"},{"from":"node_step_idea_normalizer","to":"node_step_saas_plan_and_webhook_status","out":"context","in":"p-z-node_step_idea_normalizer"},{"from":"node_step_architecture_engine","to":"node_step_mvp_builder","out":"context","in":"p-z-node_step_architecture_engine"},{"from":"node_step_architecture_engine","to":"node_step_gather_application_details","out":"context","in":"p-z-node_step_architecture_engine"},{"from":"node_step_architecture_engine","to":"node_step_saas_plan_and_webhook_status","out":"context","in":"p-z-node_step_architecture_engine"},{"from":"node_step_features_engine","to":"node_step_mvp_builder","out":"context","in":"p-z-node_step_features_engine"},{"from":"node_step_features_engine","to":"node_step_gather_application_details","out":"context","in":"p-z-node_step_features_engine"},{"from":"node_step_features_engine","to":"node_step_saas_plan_and_webhook_status","out":"context","in":"p-z-node_step_features_engine"},{"from":"node_step_market_engine","to":"node_step_gather_application_details","out":"context","in":"p-z-node_step_market_engine"},{"from":"node_step_market_engine","to":"node_step_saas_plan_and_webhook_status","out":"context","in":"p-z-node_step_market_engine"},{"from":"node_step_name_engine","to":"node_step_gather_application_details","out":"context","in":"p-z-node_step_name_engine"},{"from":"node_step_name_engine","to":"node_step_saas_plan_and_webhook_status","out":"context","in":"p-z-node_step_name_engine"},{"from":"node_step_gtmplan","to":"node_step_gather_application_details","out":"context","in":"p-z-node_step_gtmplan"},{"from":"node_step_gtmplan","to":"node_step_saas_plan_and_webhook_status","out":"context","in":"p-z-node_step_gtmplan"},{"from":"node_step_mvp_builder","to":"node_step_gather_application_details","out":"context","in":"p-z-node_step_mvp_builder"},{"from":"node_step_mvp_builder","to":"node_step_saas_plan_and_webhook_status","out":"context","in":"p-z-node_step_mvp_builder"},{"from":"node_step_gather_application_details","to":"node_step_generate_webhook_instruction","out":"context","in":"p-z-node_step_gather_application_details"},{"from":"node_step_generate_webhook_instruction","to":"node_step_dispatch_webhook","out":"context","in":"p-z-node_step_generate_webhook_instruction"},{"from":"node_step_dispatch_webhook","to":"node_step_saas_plan_and_webhook_status","out":"context","in":"p-z-node_step_dispatch_webhook"}]}
